# TDD Failure Diagnostic Flowchart
**Version:** v0.12.1
## Primary Decision: Which Phase?
```
Test behaved unexpectedly
         |
  What phase are you in?
         |
+--------+--------+--------+
RED     GREEN    REFACTOR  OTHER
|        |         |        |
```
## RED Phase Diagnostics
**Expected:** Test should FAIL | **Problem:** Test PASSES or ERRORS
### If Test Passes (Should Fail)
```
Test passes unexpectedly
         |
Check: Does feature already exist?
         |
    +----+----+
   YES       NO
    |         |
Delete    Check test
impl.     logic
    |         |
Verify    Is assertion
fails     correct?
         |
    +----+----+
   YES       NO
    |         |
Other    Fix test
issue    assertion
         |
      Revise
      test
```
**Recovery:** ASSISTANT provides corrected test
### If Test Errors (Should Fail Cleanly)
```
Test throws error/exception
         |
Check: Syntax error?
         |
    +----+----+
   YES       NO
    |         |
Fix      Check imports/
syntax   setup
    |         |
   Fix test code
         |
    Run again
```
**Recovery:** ASSISTANT fixes test code
## GREEN Phase Diagnostics
**Expected:** Test should PASS | **Problem:** Test still FAILS
### If Test Still Fails
```
Test fails after implementation
         |
Read failure message carefully
         |
What does it say?
         |
+---------+---------+---------+
Logic    Type      Missing
error    mismatch  feature
|        |         |
Fix      Fix       Add
logic    types     impl.
         |
    Run test again
         |
    +----+----+
   PASS      FAIL
    |         |
  GREEN    Revise
  phase    impl.
  done     again
```
**Recovery:** ASSISTANT provides corrected implementation
### If Other Tests Break
```
Target test passes BUT other tests fail
         |
Regression introduced
         |
Fix implementation to satisfy all tests
         |
Run full suite
         |
All green? -> GREEN phase done
```
**Recovery:** ASSISTANT revises implementation to fix regressions
## REFACTOR Phase Diagnostics
**Expected:** Tests stay GREEN | **Problem:** Tests FAIL after refactoring
```
Tests fail after refactoring
         |
IMMEDIATE ACTION: ROLLBACK
         |
Undo refactoring changes
         |
Run tests
         |
All green again?
         |
    +----+----+
   YES       NO
    |         |
Decide    Fix
next     rollback
action   first
    |
+----+----+----+
Skip  Try  Fix
      smaller test
      refactor (if brittle)
         |
   Proceed safely
```
**Recovery:** Rollback, then decide on smaller refactoring or skip
## Inconsistent Test Results
**Problem:** Test passes sometimes, fails other times
```
Test has inconsistent results
         |
Run test alone (isolated)
         |
Does it still fail inconsistently?
         |
    +----+----+
   YES       NO
    |         |
Internal  Test order
issue     dependency
    |         |
Check:    Fix test
- Timing  isolation
- Random  - Setup
  data    - Teardown
- Async   - Shared
  ops       state
         |
    Fix and verify consistency
```
**Recovery:** Ensure test isolation and determinism
## General Recovery Procedure
```
Issue detected (tests broken, wrong path)
         |
Restore previous code state (git checkout or undo)
         |
Run tests to verify green
         |
Resume TDD cycle:
- Try different approach
- Skip change
- Proceed to next behavior
```
## Quick Reference Table
| Phase    | Expected | Actual        | Action                    |
|----------|----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| RED      | FAIL     | PASS          | Revise test (invalid)     |
| RED      | FAIL     | ERROR         | Fix test (bug in test)    |
| GREEN    | PASS     | FAIL          | Revise impl (incomplete)  |
| GREEN    | PASS     | Others FAIL   | Fix regression            |
| REFACTOR | All PASS | Any FAIL      | ROLLBACK immediately      |
## Emergency Procedure
1. STOP
2. ROLLBACK to last known green state
3. Run full test suite
4. Verify all green
5. Start fresh from clean state
6. Proceed more carefully
