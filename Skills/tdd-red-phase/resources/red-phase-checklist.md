# RED Phase Checklist
**Version:** v0.12.1
Quick reference for completing RED phase successfully.
## Before Writing Test
- [ ] Behavior to test is clearly identified
- [ ] Behavior is small and focused (one thing)
- [ ] Feature/behavior does not yet exist
- [ ] Test framework is configured and working
## Writing the Test
- [ ] Test name clearly describes behavior
- [ ] Test follows AAA structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- [ ] Test uses minimal, explicit test data
- [ ] Test has clear, specific assertions
- [ ] Test includes necessary imports and setup
- [ ] Test is complete and syntactically correct
## Executing the Test
- [ ] Test runs without syntax errors
- [ ] Test FAILS (does not pass)
- [ ] Test does not throw unexpected exceptions
- [ ] Failure message clearly indicates missing implementation
## Verifying Failure
- [ ] Failure reason is correct (feature missing, not test bug)
- [ ] Failure message is understandable
- [ ] Test fails for the RIGHT reason
- [ ] Confident test will pass once feature implemented
## Before Proceeding to GREEN
- [ ] Test failure verified and documented
- [ ] Ready to implement minimum code to pass test
- [ ] Proceed autonomously to GREEN phase
## Quick Diagnostics
**If test passes unexpectedly:**
- Feature may already exist OR test is invalid
- Review test logic, check for existing implementation
**If test throws errors:**
- Test has bugs (syntax, imports, setup)
- Fix test code before proceeding
**If failure message is unclear:**
- Add descriptive assertion messages
- Simplify test to one focused assertion
